# simple-ios-jailbreak-frida-detection
A beginner-friendly iOS jailbreak detection module written in Objective-C and C++, focusing on detecting advanced rootless jailbreaks like Dopamine + RootHide. This project explores various detection vectors such as suspicious file paths, environment variables, DYLD image inspection, and more.

This is my first public project on GitHub. I'm still a beginner in iOS development and reverse engineering, and this project is part of my learning journey to better understand how the iOS system works — especially in the field of mobile security.

The goal of this project is to build a practical jailbreak detection module that goes beyond basic file checks. It aims to detect advanced and stealthy

Please keep in mind that this project is still in progress. There may be mistakes, inefficiencies, or better ways to do things — and I welcome any feedback or contributions that could help improve it. I am doing this project purely to learn, document what I discover, and share it with others who might be on a similar path.
